# Q1. Create an array of shape (3, 2) and populate it with random samples from a uniform distribution over [0, 1).
print(np.random.rand(3,2))

#Q2. Create an array of shape (1000, 1000) and populate it with random samples from a standard normal distribution. And verify that the mean and standard deviation is close enough to 0 and 1 repectively.

#Q3. Create an array of shape (3, 2) and populate it with random integers ranging from 0 to 3 (inclusive) from a discrete uniform distribution.

#Q4. Extract 1 elements from x randomly such that each of them would be associated with probabilities .3, .5, .2. Then print the result 10 times.

# Q6. Shuffle numbers between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

# Random generator
# Q7. Assign number 10 to the seed of the random generator so that you can get the same value next time.
